# QuickCheat

QuickCheat is a browser extension for helping you to create cheats or cheat sheets for the various tools and technologies you
use in dailty lives. you might be using long complicated commands  with several command line options for different tools to
accomplish different tasks and its often tough to remember those commands or type them quickly into your terminals. QuickCheat
will provide you with a place to quickly lookup such commands and also create such cheats for yourself for future use.

Features provided by QuickCheat :

- Add a tool or technology for example ```docker, consul, netstat``` any thing that you use in your daily lives. Then start
adding commands/notes which you use quite often with respect with those tools. Quickly look them up when you need to type in
that command the next time.

- In our day to day lives we visit several websites to find resources. Often we might want to leave back some note on a web
  page, so that when we come back the next time we remember easily what we were trying to do or what issue we faced and where
  to pick up our stuff from. For example, you might be reading a tutorial or a setup instruction of a tool, and then you leave
  that activity for sometime. You come back after quite some time, and now you want to know where you had left, what was your
  progress and what issues you were facing, or may be a note you want to remind you self with. you can do this very easily
  with QuickCheat. With QuickCheat you can take different custom notes for different web page and then look them up whenever
  you go back to that page later
